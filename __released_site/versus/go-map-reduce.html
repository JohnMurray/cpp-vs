  <h4>What This Code Does</h4>
<p>
    This code splits a task (summing numbers in a sequence) amongst multiple
    units of concurrency (threads/goroutines) and then collects the results
    using idiomatic approaches.
</p>


<h4>What's the Same</h4>
<p>
    Both approaches use a random number generator to populate the initial input-data.
    Both approaches also use a slice or view when handing bits of the input data
    to the concurrent sub-routine. That is, both implementations avoid explicit copies
    when passing data.
</p>
<p>
    Lastly, both implementations wait for the concurrent sub-routines to finish before
    displaying the final result. This is done in Go by reading from a channel <code>N</code>
    times, where <code>N</code> represents the number of goroutines created. C++ does this
    by calling <code>join()</code> on the thread object, which waits for the thread to exit
    before continuing.
</p>

<h4>What's Different</h4>
<p>
    The first noticeable difference, although not the main point of this versus, is the random
    number generation. See the later section <strong>Digging Deeper: Random Number Generation</strong>
    if this most interests you. The main semantic differences lie in how we collect and combine
    (reduce) the results from the concurrent operations.
</p>
<p>
    Again, it is idiomatic in Go to pass results via channels. As such our "reduction" of results
    happens within the main goroutine (summing all individual results). C++, on the other hand, uses
    an <code>atomic&lt;int&gt;</code>, which allows each thread to participate in the "reduction"
    by atomically adding their results to the <code>totalSum</code> object. Atomics in C++ rely on
    the compiler to efficiently implement for the target platform you're compiling too. That is,
    some CPUs have the ability to support atomic operations at the instruction level. For CPUs that
    do not the compiler may result to other methods, such as locks, to implement atomic operations.
</p>
<p>
    The second difference is how we represent "slices" of arrays; that is a view of an array that
    doesn't involve performing copies. Go uses the type <code>[]T</code> to represent slices and
    slices can also be "sliced" using the <code>[M:N]</code> notation. I would consider this "first
    class" support for the concept of slices. C++ on the other hand achieves this through the use of
    iterators.
</p>


<h5>Digging Deeper: C++ Slices (AKA Iterators)</h5>
<p>
    An iterator in C++ is a cursor object that points to a particular position in a data-structure.
    In our case, it is pointing to a position in a <code>std::vector</code>. In many respects the cursor
    acts like a pointer. We can advance the position by incrementing, such as <code>cur++</code>. We
    get the value by dereferencing <code>*cur</code>. We ensure that we do not advance the iterator
    beyond the end of the data-structure by comparing it to a stop position, <code>end</code>. However,
    since we are working with a fixed-size vector, this is easy for us to ensure. If we were iterating
    over a dynamically sized vector, our code would look like:
</p>
<pre class="language-cpp"><code>for (auto curr = my_vec.begin(); curr++; curr != my_vec.end()) {
  // process items
}
</code></pre>
<p>
    However, if we were going to iterate the entire array and perform the same operation for each
    loop, we could also write this code as:
</p>
<pre class="language-cpp"><code>for (auto &amp;val: my_vec) {
  // process items
}
</code></pre>
<p>
    While the two abstractions look similar, the second method is called a "ranged for loop" and
    was introduced in C++ 11. This form is the most convenient, the most limiting, and most often
    seen when operating over all elements within a loop. The first approach, using iterators, is
    the most flexible option for when a simple for loop is not all that you need. With the iterator
    you could:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pass the iterator to a function as a slice (like our example above)</li>
  <li>Increment the iterator only under certain conditions and possibly re-processing an item multiple times within a loop</li>
  <li>Process every <i>other</i> element within a loop (by incrementing the cursor by 2: <code>cur += 2</code>)</li>
  <li>Process a collection backwards using the reverse iterators (<code>rbegin()</code> and <code>rend()</code>)</li>
</ul>

    
<h5>Digging Deeper: Random Number Generation</h5>
<p>
    The Go implementation offers a random-number generator similar
    to many high-level languages. However C++, in true C++ fashion, provides some lower level
    abstractions and gives you more control over <i>how</i> your random numbers are generated.
</p>
<p>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong><code>random_device</code></strong></dt>
        <dd>
            Generates a random numeric value from hardware entropy.
            The exact method of how this is generated is compiler dependent (e.g. Clang uses
            <code>/dev/urandom</code> on Linux, while GCC uses Intel's <code>rdrand</code> instruction). It
            is also possible that your platform doesn't support a way to generate random numbers from hardware
            entropy, in which case this type would not be constructable. A value from a
            <code>random_device</code> is often used as a seed value to any of the stdlib random number
            generators.

                algorithm.  The C++ standard library provides a decently large selection of random number
                generators to use, and depending on your application you might care deeply about which one
                is used.  The list of random-number algorithms is:
            </p>

                <li><code>minstd_rand0</code></li>
                <li><code>minstd_rand</code></li>
                <li><code>mt19937</code></li>
                <li><code>mt19937_64</code></li>
                <li><code>ranlux24_base</code></li>
                <li><code>ranlux48_base</code></li>
                <li><code>ranlux24</code></li>
                <li><code>ranlux48</code></li>
                <li><code>knuth_b</code></li>
                <li><code>default_random_engine</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                For more information on what the differences are, you can view the reference page
                for the <code>&lt;random&gt;</code> header
                <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/random" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p>
        </dd>
        <dt><strong><code>uniform_int_distribution</code></strong></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                Allows us to specify a range in which all numbers in that range are equally likely to be returned
                as a random number. While not responsible for generating random numbers, this allows us to specify
                ranges of random numbers we'd like to receive which is different from the range of random numbers
                being generated, while not losing "randomness" of values.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alternatively, other distributions allow us to shift the probabilities of getting certain numbers,
                such as an
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution" target="_blank">Exponential Distribution</a>,
                which may bias number generation to one side of the range over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the time of writing, there are 20 distributions defined in the <code>&lt;random&gt;</code>
                header. You can see the full list of standard-library distributions
