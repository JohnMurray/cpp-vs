<h4>What This Code Does</h4>
<p>
    <code>addX</code> is a function that returns another function. The function it returns adds
    <code>x</code> to whatever value is provided. <code>x</code> is initially given to the
    <code>addX</code> function but is <em>captured</em> by the lambda that is returned.
</p>
<h4>What's Different</h4>
<p>
    The first notable difference is the use of <code>template &lt;typename T&gt;</code> written
    before the <code>addX</code> function. C++ must make use of "generics" in order to account
    for different numeric types, such as <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>,
    <code>double</code>, etc. This is done with what is called C++ templates. Templates are
    expanded at compile-time into concrete implementations. So, to be fair, this is less generic
    programming and more akin to sophisticated macros.
</p>
<pre class="language-cpp"><code>// When used in code, a version is compiled to match the usage.
template&lt;typename T&gt;
sum(T a, T b) {
    return a + b;
}

void main() {
    sum&lt;int&gt;(1, 2);
    sum&lt;double&gt;(1.0, 2.0);
    // this causes 2 specialized versions to be compiled
}
</code></pre>
<p>
    In Go, the types for numeric types must also be specified with options availabel such as <code>uint8</code>,
    <code>int16</code>, <code>float64</code>, and <code>complex128</code> to name some of them. However, Go
    lacks the ability to specify generic lambdas that work for all numeric types. As such, multiple versions
    would have to be created if they were needed. And they would have to have different names in order to avoid
    conflicting.
</p>
<pre class="language-go"><code>addXUInt8 := func(x uint8) func(uint8) uint8 { /* implementation */ }
addXUint16 := func(x uint16) func(uint16) uint16 { /* implementation */ }
addXUint32 := func(x uint32) func(uint32) uint32 { /* implementation */ }
// ... repeat for other numeric types
</code></pre>
<p>
    The second notable difference is that the capture portion of our lambda (<code>[]</code>) contains
    the variable <code>x</code>. This value is <em>copied</em> into the lambda. Since C++ is not a
    garbage-collected language, we have to be specific about which variables we want to capture and how
    we'd like to capture them. For things we may not want to copy, we can pass by reference.
</p>
<pre class="language-cpp"><code>int main() {
    auto bigString = "I'm a really long string, don't copy me ...";
    auto printFn = [&bigString]() -> void {
        std::cout << bigString;
    };
    printFn();
}
</code></pre>
<p>
    Note the <code>&amp;</code> before the variable name in <code>[&amp;bigString]</code>. This copies
    the reference to the variable instead of copying the value into a new variable. The caveat with this
    is that a reference is just a pointer to a location in memory. If the variable is cleaned up before
    the lambda is called, bad things could happen.
</p>

<h4>Digging Deeper</h4>
<p>
    Everything in C++ must have some sort of type and representation in memory, and the same is just
    as true for lambdas as it is any other type. Take the following:
</p>
<pre class="language-cpp"><code>int main() {
    auto age = 65;
    std::string name = "Sir Robert Christianson Manyard Sr";

    auto printPerson = [age, &name](bool includeAge) -> void {
        std::cout << name;
        if (includeAge) {
            std::cout << ", age: " << age;
        }
        std::cout << "\n";
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
    The specification for C++ says that a lambda is an object of an anonymous type, created on
    the stack. You can imagine the equivalent for this would look like:
</p>
<pre class="language-cpp"><code>struct LambdaPrintPerson {
    int age;
    std::string *name;

    void printPerson(bool includeAge) {
        std::cout << name;
        if (includeAge) {
            std::cout << ", age: " << age;
        }
        std::cout << "\n";
    }
};
int main() {
    auto age = 65;
    std::string name = "Sir Robert Christianson Manyard Sr";

    auto printPerson = LambdaPrintPerson { age, &name };
}
</code></pre>
<p>
    The reason you can <i>imagine</i> a lambda to look like this is because the exact layout
    (padding, alignment, etc) is compiler dependent according to the specification. However, it
    should make more sense now how values are "captured" by the lambda and the difference between
    capturing a reference (no copy) and capturing a value (copy).
</p>
<p>
    Note that it <i>is</i> possible to allocate a lambda on the heap, even though the default is
    to allocate on the stack. Since a lambda is just an object, it can be heap allocated with the
    <code>new</code> keyword, such as:
</p>
<pre class="language-cpp"><code>auto printPerson = new auto ([age, &name](bool includeAge) -> void {
    // function body
});
</code></pre>
<p>
    Note the only additional bit of syntax is that we must wrap the lambda in parens <code>()</code>.
</p>
