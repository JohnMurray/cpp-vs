<h4>What This Code Does</h4>
<p>
    <code>addX</code> is a function that returns another function. The function it returns adds
    <code>x</code> to whatever value is provided. <code>x</code> is initially given to the
    <code>addX</code> function but is <em>captured</em> by the lambda that is returned.
</p>
<h4>What's Different</h4>
<p>
    The first notable difference is the use of <code>template &lt;typename T&gt;</code> written
    before the <code>addX</code> function. C++ must make use of "generics" in order to account
    for different numeric types, such as <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>,
    <code>double</code>, etc. This is done with what is called C++ templates. Templates are
    expanded at compile-time into concrete implementations. So, to be fair, this is less generic
    programming and more akin to sophisticated macros.
</p>
<pre class="language-cpp"><code>// When used in code, a version is compiled to match the usage.
template&lt;typename T&gt;
sum(T a, T b) {
    return a + b;
}

void main() {
    sum&lt;int&gt;(1, 2);
    sum&lt;double&gt;(1.0, 2.0);
    // this causes 2 specialized versions to be compiled
}
</code></pre>
<p>
    In Go, the types for numeric types must also be specified with options availabel such as <code>uint8</code>,
    <code>int16</code>, <code>float64</code>, and <code>complex128</code> to name some of them. However, Go
    lacks the ability to specify generic lambdas that work for all numeric types. As such, multiple versions
    would have to be created if they were needed. And they would have to have different names in order to avoid
    conflicting.
</p>
<pre class="language-go"><code>addXUInt8 := func(x uint8) func(uint8) uint8 { /* implementation */ }
addXUint16 := func(x uint16) func(uint16) uint16 { /* implementation */ }
addXUint32 := func(x uint32) func(uint32) uint32 { /* implementation */ }
// ... repeat for other numeric types
</code></pre>
<p>
    The second notable difference is that the capture portion of our lambda (<code>[]</code>) contains
    the variable <code>x</code>. This value is <em>copied</em> into the lambda. Since C++ is not a
    garbage-collected language, we have to be specific about which variables we want to capture and how
    we'd like to capture them. For things we may not want to copy, we can pass by reference.
</p>
<pre class="language-cpp"><code>int main() {
    auto bigString = "I'm a really long string, don't copy me ...";
    auto printFn = [&bigString]() -> void {
        std::cout << bigString;
    };
    printFn();
}
</code></pre>
<p>
    Note the <code>&amp;</code> before the variable name in <code>[&amp;bigString]</code>. This copies
    the reference to the variable instead of copying the value into a new variable. The caveat with this
    is that a reference is just a pointer to a location in memory. If the variable is cleaned up before
    the lambda is called, bad things could happen.
