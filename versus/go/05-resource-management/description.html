<h4>What This Code Does</h4>
<p>
    Updates properties of a shared object using a lock, specifically a mutex, to ensure
    that updates are not applied concurrently.
</p>


<h4>What's the Same</h4>
<p>
    Both solutions define a <code>Stats</code> struct that contains two integer fields
    and a mutex lock. Both solutions also contain an <code>updateSharedObject</code> function
    which obtains an exclusive lock via the mutex and update the structs integer fields.
</p>


<h4>What's Different</h4>
<p>
    While the code is fundamentally the same, the main difference is how resources
    are managed. The Go version acquires the lock and then uses <code>defer obj.Unlock()</code>
    to clean up, in this case release the lock. However, the C++ solution only seems to acquire
    the lock but never releases it:
</p>
<pre class="language-cpp"><code> std::lock_guard m(obj->lock);</code></pre>
<p>
    However, this lock <i>is</i> released at the end of the function. This is done via RAII,
    which stands for "Resource Acquisition Is Initialization." These terms can be a bit confusing
    to understand, but let's first take a detour to explain constructors and destructors and then
    we can better define RAII.
</p>


<h5>Constructors & Destructors</h5>
<p>
    Most OOP languages have the concept of a constructor. It is essentially a creation function
    that sets up the internal state of a new instance of a class. This also exists in C++.
    However, a separate concept called a destructor also exists. The purpose of the destructor
    is mirror to the constructor in that it tears down the object before the memory is reclaimed.
    Take the following class for example:
</p>
<pre class="language-cpp"><code>class int_array {
private:
    int *arr;

public:
    int_array(size_t size) {
        this.arr = new int[size];
    }
    ~int_array() {
        delete [] this.arr;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
    <code>int_array</code> is a class that wraps a C-style array. Upon construction, an arary of
    dynamic size is allocated on the heap. If we were to simply free instances of the
    <code>int_array</code> without freeing the memory allocated on construction, we would have a
    memory leak. Instead we define a destructor, <code>~int_array</code>, which frees this memory.
    We can construct and delete an instance of <code>int_arary</code> like so:
</p>
<pre class="language-cpp"><code>auto arr = new int_array(16);
// use array ...

delete arr;
</code></pre>
<p>
    <code>new</code> both initializes memory on the heap for our <code>int_array</code> instance,
    but also calls the constructor. Similarly, <code>delete</code> calls the destructor and then
    frees the memory for out <code>int_array</code> instance.
</p>
<p>
    What if the our <code>int_array</code> is allocated on the stack, like so:
</p>
<pre class="language-cpp"><code>void someFunction() {
    auto arr = int_array(16);
    // use array ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>
    In this case, because our <code>int_array</code> instance was allocated on the stack
    (note no use of <code>new</code> here), it will automatically be free'd when the
    function ends. However, C++ will also ensure that any destructors are called before the
    objects are freed.
</p>


<h5>Understanding RAII</h5>
<p>
    An alternative, an likely more understandable, name for RAII is <strong>Scope Based
    Resource Management</strong>, where a "Resource" could be anything such as:
    <ul>
        <li>Memory</li>
        <li>DB Connections</li>
        <li>Sockets</li>
        <li>ThreadPool Workers</li>
    </ul>
    Essentially anything that requires some setup and cleanup can implement the RAII pattern
    by following a couple of rules:
    <ol>
        <li>Acquire the required resources on construction</li>
        <li>Release acquired resources on destruction</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
    Given these rules, we can now see how/where our original locking C++ code works. The acquisition
    of the lock is represented by the <code>std::lock_guard</code> type and the guard,
    <code>m</code>, is allocated on the stack. At the end of function, <code>m</code> is destructed
    (this is where the lock is released) and freed.
</p>
<p>
    This pattern is extremely common in modern C++ code. Take for example some of the collections
    from the std-lib, such as <code>unordered_map</code> or <code>vector</code>:
</p>
<pre class="language-cpp"><code>void someFunction() {
    std::vector<int> vec;

    // dynamically grow heap-allocated, backing array
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
        vec.push_back(i);
    }

    // end function without explicit cleanup of vector
}
</code></pre>


<h4>Digging Deeper</h4>
<p>
    Due to the behavior of stack allocated objects and RAII principals, it is often preferred
    to completely avoid the explicit use of <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code>. Instead,
    everything should be allocated on the stack. These stack allocated objects can then manage
    heap allocations under the covers and ensure proper allocation and cleanup happens with the
    object life cycle (construction, destruction).
</p>
<p>
    When an object must be allocated on the heap, either directly or within another RAII object,
    then a <i>smart pointer</i> should be used.  Smart pointers are a way to represent heap allocated
    resources on the stack that contain the same RAII principals. That is, when they are no
    longer in scope, they clean up the associated heap memory. The main two smart pointers from
    the standard library to know are <code>unique_ptr</code> and <code>shared_ptr</code>.
</p>
<p>
    <code>unique_ptr</code> is a smart pointer that is only allowed to have a single owner. If you
    want to pass a <code>unique_ptr</code> to a function then it must be <i>moved</i>. Moving means
    giving ownership of the object away. A moved value can no longer be referenced and the lifetime
    is now transferred to whomever it was moved to. To make this more clear:
</p>
<pre class="language-cpp"><code>{ // start of scope
    unique_ptr&lt;string&gt; a;

    { // start of scope
        unique_ptr&lt;string&gt; b = make_unique&lt;string&gt;("Hello, World");

        // not allowed, as this type of assignment tries to copy `b`, but
        // unique_ptr's cannot be copied
        auto c = b;

        // `a` now own's the unique_ptr
        a = move(b);

        // not allowed, `a` now owns the unique_ptr
        b-&gt;length();
    } // end of scope, `b` is cleaned up but the memory allocated for
      // "Hello, World" is untouched since `a` is now the owner

    // allowed, since `a` is the owner of the unique_ptr
    a-&gt;length();

} // end of scope, `a` is cleaned up and memory is reclaimed
</code></pre>
<p>
    <code>shared_ptr</code> is a smart pointer that allows multiple owners. Each time a
    <code>shared_ptr</code> is copied, a ref-counter is incremented. When a <code>shared_ptr</code>
    is destructed (cleaned up), the ref-counter is decremented. When the ref-counter hits 0,
    then the associated heap-allocated memory is cleaned up. To make this more clear:
</p>
<pre class="language-cpp"><code>{ // start of scope
    shared_ptr&lt;string&gt; a;

    { // start of scope
        // new shared pointer, ref-count is 1
        shared_ptr&lt;string&gt; b = make_unique&lt;string&gt;("Hello, World");

        // allowed, copy is made and ref-count is 2
        auto c = b;

        // allowed, copy is made and ref-count is 3
        a = c;

        // both allowed to operate on underlying data
        b-&gt;length();
        c-&gt;length();
    } // end of scope, `b` and `c` cleaned up, ref-count is 1

} // end of scope, `a` is cleaned up, ref-count is 0, memory is freed
</code></pre>
<p>
    With these two constructs, you should never need to use a raw pointer (<code> *obj</code>)
    or the <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code> keywords. This is a major step toward
    writing safer, more modern C++.
