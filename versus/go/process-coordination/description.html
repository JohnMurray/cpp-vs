<h4>What This Code Does</h4>
<p>
    Given the string <code>Hello, World!</code> each program must create as many concurrent
    units (threads for C++, goroutines for Go) as there are characters. Then the threads
    must coordinate (without the help of the main thread) to print out the characters in
    order. The concurrent units may receive, at a minimum, the character they are responsible
    for as well as the index of the character to print.
