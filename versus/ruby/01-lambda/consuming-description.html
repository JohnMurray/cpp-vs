<h4>What This Code Does</h4>
<p>
    <code>sendEmail</code> is a user-defined function that sends and email and
    then calls one of two callbacks provided by the user. This shows how to receive
    (consume) lambdas in your own code.
</p>

<h4>What's Different</h4>
<p>
    Consuming lambdas in user-defined functions is very straight forward. The main
    difference here, yet again, is that the C++ version has to do slightly more work
    in order to define all of the types. Beyond the type declarations, the two versions
    are very similar.
