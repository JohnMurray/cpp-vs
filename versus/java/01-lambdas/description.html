<h4>What This Code Does</h4>
<p>
    The above code creates a simple lambda that adds <code>1</code> to the
    value provided. It is called directly and also passed as a value into
    functions that operate over lists of data.
</p>

<h4>What's the Same</h4>
<p>
    The Java and the C++ version define a lambda that is callable, directly in the case
    of C++ and through the <code>apply()</code> method in Java. Both versions also
    define "pure" lambdas that do not capture any local state or perform any kind of
    mutating state-changes (i.e. calling the code, alone, does not affect our program).
</p>
<p>
    In Java, a lambda is really just syntactic sugar for creating an anonymous instance
    of the functional interfaces.
</p>

<h4>What's Different</h4>
    The two examples have very little differences, 

    The differences mostly lie in type declarations and syntax. While the structure is
    the same, C++ must define all of the parameter and return types. This is most visible
    in how our lambda is structured.
</p>
<p>
    <code>std::function</code> is used to represent the return and parameter types like so:
</p>
<pre class="language-cpp"><code>std::function&lt;ReturnType(Arg1Type, Arg2Type, Arg3Type)&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
    The lambda itself has 4 parts. The capture, the parameters, the return type, and the body.
</p>
<pre class="language-cpp"><code>auto lambda = [](int param1, int param2) -> int {
    return param1 + param2;
}
</code></pre>
<p>
    The <code>[]</code> part is a list of variables we'd like to "capture" in our lambda (more on
    this in the next section). The parameters are everything between <code>(</code> and
    <code>)</code> and what comes after the <code>-&gt</code>, but before the <code>{</code>,
    is the return type. And what's in the curly-braces is the function body. It's also worth pointing
    out that we must always use <code>return</code> if we want to return a value from our lambda. There
    is no short-hand equivalent of JavaScript's curly-brace-less lambda ():
    <pre class="language-cpp"><code>const addOne = (x) => x + 1;</code></pre>
</p>
