<h4>What This Code Does</h4>
<p>
	Demonstrate the use of lambda functions as callbacks for basic asynchronous tasks.
	<ul>
		<li>Scheduling a Hello-World-lambda for immediate deferred execution</li>
		<li>Quitting the program on an external <code>KILL</code> signal</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	It is common for a program to instruct the operating system to perform <em>long-running computations</em> or
	to respond to <em>events from external sources</em>. A long running computation could be copying a large file or
	scheduling a timer. External events can be user inputs in a GUI program, or for a server program the activity in the network for example.
	To avoid getting unresponsive an application typically delegates large work loads into parallel running threads or
	the operating system. To consume the outcome of such an operation the program must run a loop which listens to
	events coming from the operating system or own threads.
</p>
<p>
	To reduce the complexity of a program and to make it less error-prone, it is advisable to leave the management of threads
	and event loops to well established third-party libraries.
</p>
<h4>What's the Same</h4>
<p>
	Both examples set up an environment to support asynchronous execution. Both programs run non-blocking down to
	the bottom of the program without any output.
	We keep the program running unless the program is sent a termination signal.

<h4>What's Different</h4>
<p>
	<h5>Node.js</h5>
		Being essentially single-threaded JavaScript can rely on it's engine for all parallel executing multi-threading stuff.
		Today lambda callbacks, promises, async/await etc. are baked into the language to help with asynchronous operations.
		The <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/event-loop-timers-and-nexttick/">Node.js event loop</a> starts as soon as the
		process starts, and ends when no further callbacks remain to be performed.
	<p>
		The program is kept running using a practically never-ending timer. This extra step is needed in this example because
		when <code>process.on</code> adds it's callback to the JS event-loop the program has already exited.
	</p>

	<h5>C++ with Boost.Asio</h5>
	<p>
		<a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_68_0/doc/html/boost_asio.html">Boost.Asio</a>
		provides a platform-independent asynchronous api for common long-running tasks in networking, timers, serial ports and signals.
		The outcome events are typically processed by continuations (callback functions) or can be forwarded to <code>std::future</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_68_0/doc/html/thread.html">Boost.Thread</a> v.4 provides a implementation for
		future continuations as proposed in <a href="http://www.modernescpp.com/index.php/component/content/article/44-blog/multithreading/multithreading-c-17-and-c-20/279-std-future-extensions?Itemid=239">C++14 TS Extensions for Concurrency V1</a>. C++ Futures are a general high-level abstraction for background threads.
		With the <code>.then</code> continuations they have much in common with the promises of JS.
	</p>
	<p>
		The program is kept running as long as there are pending operations (i.e.)<code>terminationSignals</code> scheduled to <code>asio::io_context</code>.
