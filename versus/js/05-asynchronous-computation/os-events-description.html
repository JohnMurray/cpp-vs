<h4>What This Code Does</h4>
<p>
	It is common for a program to instruct the operating system to perform <em>long-running computations</em> or
	to respond to <em>events from external sources</em>. A long running computation could be copying a large file or
	scheduling a timer. The external events can be a GUI program user inputs, or for a server program activity in the network for example.
	In this role the operating system (OS) is a service provider which exposes blocking and non-blocking methods.
	Delegating thread management and polling loops to the OS by using non-blocking asynchronous OS methods,
	the C++ program is reduced in its complexity and is made less error-prone without being unresponsive during
	the execution time of background computations.
</p>
<p>
	Asynchrony can also be achieved with <em>long-running internal computations</em> by moving them into background threads.
	To avoid blocking the main thread of execution the program instructs the OS to execute the background thread and signal
	the main thread when the background thread has exited.
</p>
<p>
	Calling non-blocking OS methods from C++ is trivial (it's what C++ is made for), but to get notified of external events, once an
	event loop must be implemented and registered with the OS. Also OS-dependent C-callbacks or background threads
	have to be registered for each non-blocking method.
</p>
<p>
	<a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_68_0/doc/html/boost_asio.html">Boost.Asio</a>
	provides a platform-independent asynchronous api for common long-running tasks in networking, timers, serial ports and signals.
	The outcome events are typically processed by continuations (callback functions) or can be forwarded to <code>std::future</code>.
</p>
<p>
	<a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_68_0/doc/html/thread.html">Boost.Thread</a> v.4 provides a implementation for
	future continuations as proposed in <a href="http://www.modernescpp.com/index.php/component/content/article/44-blog/multithreading/multithreading-c-17-and-c-20/279-std-future-extensions?Itemid=239">C++14 TS Extensions for Concurrency V1</a>. C++ Futures are a general high-level abstraction for background threads.
	With the <code>.then</code> continuations they have much in common with JS promises.
</p>
<h4>What's the Same</h4>
<p>
	In both cases the code sets up an environment to support asynchronous execution. Both programs run non-blocking down to
	the bottom of the program without any output.

	Two examples of asynchronous work are given:
	<ul>
		<li>Scheduling a Hello-World-lambda for immediate deferred execution</li>
		<li>Quitting the program on an external <code>KILL</code> signal</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<h4>What's Different</h4>
<p>
	<h5>Node.js</h5>
		JavaScript can rely on the engine for all OS interfacing stuff. It does not need extra libraries.
		The intricacies of the Node.js event loop are described <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/event-loop-timers-and-nexttick/">here</a>.

	<h5>Boost.Asio</h5>
	The boilerplate code to setup the <code>Boost.Asio</code> global context is minimal.
	<p>
		Boost.Asio commences all background work in a single method <code>asio::context::run</code>.
		The method blocks as long as there are pending asynchronous computations. In the other event
		the program will quit.

		Here we choose to keep the program running unless the program is sent a termination signal. There is always the
		pending wait operation <code>terminationSignals</code> to keep the program running.
	</p>
