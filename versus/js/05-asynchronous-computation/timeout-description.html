<h4>What This Code Does</h4>
<p>
	Delaying or scheduling the execution of functions lambdas or methods on the same thread without blocking.
	<ol>
		<li>Register a 11-day dummy <code>keepAliveTimer</code> to keep the program from exiting early.</li>
		<li>Define a worker function <code>quitAfterGreetingPerson</code> which prints a greeting to the console before killing the <code>keepAliveTimer</code>.</li>
		<li>Schedule the execution of the worker providing a parameter after one second.</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<h4>What's the Same</h4>
<p>
	The building blocks when registering function for execution through timers is the same. One has to specify a
	<ul>
		<li>delay,
		</li><li>a lambda, free function, <code>std::function</code> or bound member function and</li>
		<li>additional parameters</li>
	</ul>.
</p>
<h4>What's Different</h4>
<p>
	In C++ the parameters need to be provided by <code>std::bind</code> while in JavaScript they are appended as
	the <code>setTimeout</code> arguments. (Though one could use <code>Function.prototype.bind</code> to make it like in C++).
</p>
<p>
	In C++ the definition of the timer and the registering of the worker are separate. Thus under circumstances
	a timer may already be expired before a handler is registered. This is not possible in JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
	Very different from JavaScript in C++ not only the expiry but also the canceling of a timer invokes the handler.
	Cancellation is reported with the special <code>boost::asio::error::operation_aborted</code> error code.
</p>
<p>
	Destroying a Boost.Asio timer object cancels any outstanding asynchronous wait operations associated with the timer
	as if by calling <code>timer.cancel()</code>.
	<p>
	Thus to achieve similarity with JavaScript
	when creating timers in C++ block scopes, e.g. lambdas, one should rather create timers on the heap with <code>new</code>
	and share them via strong reference <code>std::shared_ptr</code> with their handler. This way the timer will not
	be destructed until the handler was called (i.e by timer expiry or cancellation).
