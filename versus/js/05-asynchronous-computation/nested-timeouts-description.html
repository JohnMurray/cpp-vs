<h4>What This Code Does</h4>
<p>
	Nesting the execution of scheduled lambdas on the same thread without blocking is demonstrated by
	writing the two sub sentences of Neil Armstrong's Moon-Landing quote delayed in time.
	<ol>
		<li>Register a timer to call it's handler one second after program start.</li>
		<li>The handler prints out the first part of the quote and then schedules another timer with one second delay</li>
		<li>to print out the rest of the quote.</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<h4>What's the Same</h4>
<p>
	The nesting of asynchronously executed lambdas is demonstrated in both languages.
</p>
<h4>What's Different</h4>
	<p>
		In C++ the destruction of a Boost.Asio timer cancels any pending asynchronous wait operations.
		Since exiting a C++ block scope calls the destructor of all stack objects, we avoid this for the inner timer by
		creating it on the heap and manage access and lifetime by a C+ shared pointer created on the stack.
		In order to prevent it's reference count drop to zero and get the timer object destroyed nevertheless
		when the block scope exits, we have to pass a copy of it into the scheduled timeout handler.
	</p>
	<p>
		This looks awkward because the timer object is not really used in it's completion handler. While JavaScript
		itself manages the lifetime of it's reference objects - like timers -; in C++ the reference counting is left to
		the application.
	</p>
<p>
	Also C++ requires checking the error code parameter of the handler to distinguish timer expiry from timer cancellation.
