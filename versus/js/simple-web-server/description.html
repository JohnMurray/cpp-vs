    <strong class="font-bold">The problem</strong> is to describe a simple web-server that responds with
    the string "Hello, World" to a simple route (<code>/</code>).
</p>

<p>
    <strong class="font-bold">The JavaScript</strong> solution uses <a href="https://nodejs.org">NodeJS</a>
    (a server-side JavaScript platform) to implement a simple server with a single-route.
    <strong class="font-bold">The C++</strong> solution, in similar fashion, uses <a href="{{gh}}/ipkn/crow">Crow</a>
    to define a simple route in the same way.

    C++, as of C++-17, does not have any standard networking features and thus no standard libraries
    for creating web-servers. <a href="{{gh}}/ipkn/crow">Crow</a> is a simple 3rd-party framework in the style of
    <a href="http://sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>/<a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> for
    creating simple web apps. Other frameworks such as <a href="">Boost Beast</a>
    or <a href="{{gh}}/cutelyst/cutelyst">Cutelyst</a> also exist to serve this need.
</p>

<p>
    It is worth noting that networking in the standard library is coming via the Networking
    <span title="Technical Specification" class="tool-tip">TS</span>. This
    <span title="Technical Specification" class="tool-tip">TS</span> has been published, which essentially
    means these features are available in a experimental/beta mode as people try them out allowing for any
    minor adjustments before being "written in stone." You can find the status for all specifications on the
    <a href="https://isocpp.org/std/status">ISO CPP</a> website.
    <br />
    Asynchronous networking I/O can also be achieved today with
    <a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/master/doc/html/boost_asio.html">Boost.Asio</a>,
    which currently follows the Networking TS in it's implementation.
