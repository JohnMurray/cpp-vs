<h4>What This Code Does</h4>
<p>
    The goal of the above code is to combine functions together in order to
    create new functions. The composability of functions to generate new functions
    is a form of code-reuse and application of
    <span title="Don't Repeat Yourself" class="tool-tip">DRY</span> typically found
    in more functional or function-oriented languages. Our specific goal is to combine
    <code>collect</code>, which iterates over collection of items, with a function that
    works on single-elements, to create a new function that works over a collection of
    elements, to calculate an aggregate value.
</p>

<h4>What's the Same</h4>
<p>
    The structure of both solutions is identical. While both are idiomatic, both are also
    very raw. <strong class="text-bold">JavaScript</strong> has many libraries to help
    with this, such as <a href="https://lodash.com/">Lodash</a>. Similarly, C++ has
    <a href="{{gh}}/boostorg/hof">Boost HOF</a> which contains utilities specifically for
    <span title="Higher Order Functions" class="tool-tip">HOF</span> programming in C++.
</p>

<h4>What's Different</h4>
<p>
    The differences mostly lie in type declarations, syntax, and the necessity to use generic-like
    programming in order to work for multiple types (<code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, etc).
    Most of these differences are covered in the <a href="{{base_url}}/versus/js-lambdas">Lambdas</a>
    versus.
</p>
<p>
    This is actually a really good thing! C++, being a language incredibly focused on performance
    and low-level details, can still make use of higher-level language features one would expect
    to find in modern programming languages.
