<h4>What This Code Does</h4>
<p>
    <em>Partial application</em> is the ability to create a new function
    by only partially applying parameters to the original function.
</p>
<p>
    In the above code we create a new function from <code>sum(a, b)</code> by
    applying <code>5</code> as the first parameter. This new function
    <code>addFive</code> is the same as calling <code>sum(a, b)</code> where
    <code>a</code> is always <code>5</code>.
</p>
<h4>What's the Same</h4>
<p>
    Both <strong class="text-bold">the Javascript</strong> and <strong class="text-bold">
    the C++</strong> solutions make use of 3rd party libraries and both create a new
    function by passing the <code>sum</code> and the value <code>5</code> into the 3rd
    party's <code>partial</code> function.
</p>
<h4>What's Different</h4>
<p>
    Again, the main differences here are the types (which we understand now) and the libraries
    used. You may note one small difference that an additional utility is used in the C++ code
    that is not present in the JavaScript version, <code>BOOST_HOF_LIFT</code>. This is a simple
    utility that allows us to use <code>partial</code> on templated functions.
