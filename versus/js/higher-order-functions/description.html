<!--
    I think the biggest thing to talk about here is that C++ is
    typed, and much of the difficulty of reading the C++ code from
    the JS code stems from the fact that we need to be more explicit
    in our function typing. It might even be good to expand and say
    that we could use the C++ 17 feature of `auto` return types.

<h4>What This Code Does</h4>
<p>
    The goal of the above code is to combine functions together in order to
    create new functions. The composability of functions to generate new functions
    is a form of code-reuse and application of
    <span title="Don't Repeat Yourself" class="tool-tip">DRY</span> typically found
    in more functional or function-oriented languages. Our specific goal is to combine
    <code>collect</code>, which iterates over collection of items, with a function that
    works on single-elements, to create a new function that works over a collection of
    elements, to calculate an aggregate value.

<h4>What's the Same</h4>
<p>
    The structure of both solutions is identical. While both are idiomatic, both are also
    very raw. <strong class="text-bold">JavaScript</strong> has many libraries to help
    with this, such as <a href="https://lodash.com/">Lodash</a>. Similarly, C++ has
    <a href="{{gh}}/boostorg/hof">Boost HOF</a> which contains utilities specifically for
    <span title="Higher Order Functions" class="tool-tip">HOF</span> programming in C++.
