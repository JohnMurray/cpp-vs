    I think the biggest thing to talk about here is that C++ is
    typed, and much of the difficulty of reading the C++ code from
    the JS code stems from the fact that we need to be more explicit
    in our function typing. It might even be good to expand and say
    that we could use the C++ 17 feature of `auto` return types.
