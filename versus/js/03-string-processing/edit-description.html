<h4>What This Code Does</h4>
<p>
    This code modifies the string cases (to upper and lower case) and modifies string contents
    using both string-literals and regular expressions as lookup values. 
</p>
<h4>What's the Same</h4>
<p>
    Almost everything.
</p>
<h4>What's Different</h4>
<p>
    Almost nothing. Well, we did cheat this time around and use the Boost library. Using a freely
    available utility library is common in many C++ projects and allows us to fill the gaps that
    exist in the standard library. With this library added, our code is now very comparable,
    aside from syntactic differences, to the JS version.
