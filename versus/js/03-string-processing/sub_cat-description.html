<h4>What This Code Does</h4>
<p>
    This code demonstrates concatenation (combining) of strings as well as taking
    sub-sections of strings. Such code is commonly found across application domains.
</p>

<h4>What's the Same</h4>
<p>
    Both implementations take advantage of built-in string manipulation to concat
    strings and look at string sub-sections.
</p>

<h4>What's Different</h4>
<p>
    C++ makes use something called <code>std::string_view</code> where as the JS examples
    siply return new strings. A <code>std::string_view</code> behaves like a string, but
    doesn't perform any copies when looking at sub-sectins of a string.
</p>
<p>
    <code>std::string_view</code> is also useful when you want to manipulate the "view" of
    a string without actually changing (mutating) the underlying data. This is particularly
    useful when writing methods that accept data immutably, but can still "simulate" changes
    locally without any unseen "effects" (if you come from a functional programming
    background, the idea of avoiding effects should be very familiar).
</p>
<p>
    It's worth noting that <code>string</code>s in JS are immutable. Thus, any methods
    that return a portion of a string, such as <code>slice</code> could, under the covers,
    return a view into the same data.
