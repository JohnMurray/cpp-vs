<h4>What This Code Does</h4>
<p>
    This code simply trims leading and trailing whitespace from a string.
</p>

<h4>What's the Same</h4>
<p>
    Almost nothing.
</p>

<h4>What's Different</h4>
<p>
    Almost everything.
</p>

<p>
    The most obvious difference is that the C++ version goes about writing the
    <i>implementation</i> for <code>trim</code> rather than using something from
    the standard library. Why is that?
</p>
<p>
    Well... C++ can, at times, be very minimal in its stdlib. That is to say that no
    <code>trim</code> function exists directly. However, using the ability to remove
    sub-sections of the <code>std::string</code> along with some utilities from the
    <code>&lt;algorithm&gt;</code> header (<code>std::find_if</code>), a simple and
    efficient version can be created.
</p>
<p>
    In practice, most organizations will either develop their own internal utility
    libraries that would likely include these functions or adopt an open-source
    implementation such as <a href="https://www.bost.org">Boost</a>. As an example,
    if we were using Boost, we would simply write:
<pre class="language-cpp"><code>#include &lt;boost/algorithm/string.hpp&gt;

boost::trim(msg);
</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
    Obviously there is a bit of code missing (the <code>main</code> function and
    declaration of <code>msg</code>, but you can see that the important code is
    now equivalent to the JS version.
</p>
<p>
    The other difference worth pointing out is that the C++ does the modification to
    the string in-place. If we were to examine the <code>msg</code> in the JavaScript
    version after running trim, you'll notice nothing was changed.
</p>
<p>
<pre class="language-js"><code>var msg = " \t\n\t Hello, World! \t\n\t ";
msg.trim();       // value returned is "Hello, World!"
console.log(msg); // prints " \t\n\t Hello, World! \t\n\t "
</code></pre>
</p>
