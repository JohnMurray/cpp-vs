            <strong class="font-bold">Cpp Vs</strong> is a site that breaks down barriers
            to learning C++ by comparing solutions of simple and/or common problems in other
            (likely more well known) languages.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's be honest. Learning C++ can be rather intimidating, scary even. But C++ is
            likely not as hard as people work it up to be. By comparing simple examples in
            languages they may already know, or at least are more familiar with,
            we gently introduce new-comers to C++.

            What Cpp Vs <strong class="font-bold">is not</strong> (or at least tries not to be):
            <ul>
                <li>A show of superiority of the C++ language</li>
                <li>A bashing of other languages (kinda similar to the first point)</li>
                <li>A showcase of "clever" hacks and other hard-to-read code</li>
            </ul>

            All C++ code here has been tested on Linux platforms using version 6.0 of the Clang
            compiler and using the <code>-std=c++17</code> option. Examples that use boost were
            tested with version <code>1.65.1</code>, from the package available on Ubuntu 18.04.
