# CPP-VS

Comparing Cpp to other languages to showcase modern C++ and make it less
scary.



## Contributing

TODO: Create guidelines for submissions/tickets to make new comparisons.

## Building the Site

In order to build the site, you will need to have the following dependencies installed

+ [Less Compiler](http://lesscss.org/)
+ [CTemplate](https://github.com/rockdreamer/ctemplate)
+ Compiler with C++ 17 support (I use Clang)

You can generate the site by running `make` or the longer, more explicit, version
`make compile && make generate`.
